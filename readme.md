#The Dish

The Dish is proof of concept, showing how a convenient phone app can help folks identify dishes while out antiquing.

##Motivation

Fake antiques are a common issue in the antiquing community. Modern technology has the ability to help folks spot an authentic piece without having to do extensive Google searches or tote a stack of books with them. I was not able to find products aimed at hobbyists that had this functionality.

##User Experience

The user can access the phone's camera through the app. The image is analyzed and identified and the results are shown via a message on the user's screen.

##Future Features

I would like users to be able to add images of their own to aid with further identification of pieces. This requires a lot of data to do properly, and forming a community that continually lends their knowledge to the project would make it more useful and accurate over time.

##Tech

Knex, Postgress, Node.js, React.js, vize.ai
